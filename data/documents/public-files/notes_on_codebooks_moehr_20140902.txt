## Setup (SUR) ##

Needs a lot of work.


## FSQ ##

The FSQ ACASI word document contains questions SMQ002 -- SMQ008 which are instructions for the SP. These vars are SMQ because in previous years, smoking was the first ACASI section. The preliminary UWSC codebook for 2014 contains SMQ002 but not SMQ003 -- SMQ008.

Questions FSQ002 -- FSQ080 are exactly the same. 

Questions FSQ151r2 and FSQ170r2 are exactly the same.

Removed questions FSQ090 and FSQ162r2

The variables database contains the real question numbers plus an entire copy of `FSQ*****_R` variables. The underscore-R variables are an indicator of whether the SP is still listening to the audio when they reach the question.

### Derivied FSQ vars ###

- Still the same:
    - FSQ_RAW_SCORE
    - FSQ_FOOD_INSECURE
- Changed
    + fsq_anyissue and fsq_total included FASQ090 and FAS162r2 as part of a count up, so the values will drift 

## DQM ##

Completely new.

Some questions may be substantively the same as questions on the adult diet questionnaire. May need to make a cross walk to allow for researchers to analyze a single dataset across ages.

DQM010 -- DQM060 for ages between 12 and 17.

DQM110 -- DQM160 for ages between 3 and 11.

### Derived DQM Vars ###

The kid version of diet is actually a combination of the questions found in the adult diet (DIQ) and the adult food (FOOD) instruments. There are no derived vars in DIQ that should be replicated. FOOD has derived variables for servings of fruits, vegs, and maybe sugar sweetened beverages. Maybe we should try to replicate those in the kids.

## Discrimination (QG) ##

Moved from G to I in then SAQ order.

These sentences were removed from the instructions: "Please remember that any information you provide is strictly confidential and will never be identified with you as an individual.  Letâ€™s start with experiences you may have had on a day-to-day basis."

Shortened from 2013.

Dropped the daily frequency of discrimination questions:

Dropped QG_DSC_1A -- QG_DSC_1G and QG_DSC_2.

Renumbering?

QG_DSC_3A -- QG_DSC_3H  => 1 -- 8

QG_DSC_4 => 9

QG_DSD_5 => 10

QG_DSC_6 => 11

QG_DSC_7 => 12

In 2013 (and maybe past years?) the variables database had a record for QGSKIP, but it did not have a sas_var so it isn't in any of the codebooks. I'm guessing this was an indicator in the Oracle forms to skip the entire section. I am removing it.

### DSC (discrimination) derived variables ###

- Stay the same
    + DSC_LIFETIME
    + DSC_LIFEGRP
- Removed because questions are no longer asked.
    + DSC_EVERYDAY
    + DSC_DAILYGRP



## SDQ (Sensory and Dental) ##

I acquired this instrument when Matt W. left.

It was deleted for 2014.

### SDQ derived vars ###

All of the 2013 SDQ derived vars were just "enter all that apply" so we can safely ignore them.

## OCQ (Occupation) ##

Shortened the insturctions a lot.

Dropped the questions about the longest held job.

Moved three questions:
OCQ14010p: instructions to cue about shopping, excercise, and errands
OCQ14010: address of your place of employment
OCQ14020: how far from home to wor
... from after OCQ140 to after OCQ175, i.e. the end of the section.

OCQ14010_1: I noticed that this question is left out of previous data. It is possible that this was put in by survey center to manage the skip patterns for working at home vs. address of place of work. Probably need to go back and add it to previous years for consitency.

### OCQ Derived vars ###

The OI coding variables are called "derived" even though they aren't derived in SAS code like the other derived vars -- they are reviewed and coded by UWSC and sent to us as separate data fields. Should be exactly the same beteween 2014 and 2015.
